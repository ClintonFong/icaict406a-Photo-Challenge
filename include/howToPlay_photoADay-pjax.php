                    This not a challenge that if you miss a day or two you're out and you don't have to wait for the next month to start just join in. 
                    The aim is to get you out and about enjoying the world around you.
                </p>

                    Playing along with photo a day is very easy
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Each month around the 28th I will add a new list to the site for the next months challenge like the photo below.</li>
                    <li>Each day look at the daily prompt and take a photo according to whatever the prompt is. For example for day 1the prompt is Sky so all you need to do is take a photo of the sky as you see it.</li>
                    <li>Once you've taken the photo it's time to share it. There are loads of places you can share it on like your own Facebook page, Instagram, Twitter or my Facebook group Lynxx's photo challenge</li>
                    <li>
                        The only I ask if you use someone else's photo you get permission and give them credit for their work, like this one by a good friend of mine.<br />
